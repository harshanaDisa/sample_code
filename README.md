Here are some key points you should learn to develop a Symfony application:

1. **Understanding the Symfony Architecture**: Symfony follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. Understanding how controllers, entities (models), and views (Twig templates) interact is crucial.

2. **Routing**: Learn how to define routes using annotations or YAML, and how to generate URLs.

3. **Controllers**: Controllers handle the business logic of your application. Learn how to create controllers and return responses.

4. **Twig Templating Engine**: Twig is the default templating engine in Symfony. Learn how to create views with Twig.

5. **Doctrine ORM**: Doctrine is the default ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) in Symfony. Learn how to define entities, run queries, and perform database operations.

6. **Forms**: Learn how to create forms, handle form submissions, and validate form data.

7. **Validation**: Learn how to use Symfony's validation constraints to validate data.

8. **Services and Dependency Injection**: Services are central to Symfony applications. Learn how to define services and inject them into your classes.

9. **Security**: Learn how to handle authentication and authorization in Symfony.

10. **Testing**: Learn how to write unit tests and functional tests for your Symfony application.

11. **Console Commands**: Learn how to create console commands for tasks that should be run from the command line.

12. **Events and Event Listeners**: Learn how to use Symfony's event system to hook into various parts of your application.

Remember, Symfony is a vast framework and it's okay not to know everything at once. Start with the basics and gradually delve into more complex topics as you gain more experience.
